## My Passion for Guqin

I have been playing the **Guqin**, a traditional Chinese string instrument, for four years. The Guqin is known for its deep cultural heritage, subtle tones, and meditative playing style.

### Favorite Pieces
- **Long Xiang Cao (Dragon Soars)**  
  A powerful and uplifting piece, symbolizing strength, ambition, and the soaring spirit of a dragon.
  
- **Xiao Xiang Shui Yun (Mist and Clouds Over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers)**  
  A calm and poetic piece that evokes the serene landscapes of ancient China, reflecting emotions of longing and nostalgia.

Playing the Guqin allows me to connect with Chinese history and philosophy, offering a peaceful balance to my analytical studies.
