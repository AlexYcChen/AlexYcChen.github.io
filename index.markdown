# Welcome to My Website

Hi! Iâ€™m Alex Chen, a Master of Engineering candidate in Operations Research at Cornell University.  

I have strong interests in data-driven decision-making, optimization, and machine learning, with experience across consulting, supply chain, and financial analytics.

Beyond academics, I am passionate about traditional Chinese culture and have been playing the Guqin, a classical Chinese instrument, for four years.

This is where I share my academic journey, professional projects, and personal interests in operations research, data science, and music.
